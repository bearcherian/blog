      <title>AEM Responsive Grid with 0px height</title>

      <description>In AEM when you create a new page component with a editable area that uses the responsive grid (wcm/foundation/components/responsivegrid) you might experience an issue where the editable area appears, but has no height, and is unusable. All you get is a thin blue line where the editable area should be.
The cause of this is a missing include. To initialize the AEM editing features, an JSP is loaded that initializes all of the editable areas, as well as some other things.</description>

      <title>Smart ALT field validation</title>

      <description>We had a requirement to enforce alt attributes on images. Sounds simple, just set the alt field to required. The problem is when you do that for components that use images, like Text &amp;amp; Image. If a user decides to enter text, but not use the image portion the ALT text is still required, and the alert for a missing field still appears.
To fix this we add a function to the &amp;lsquo;validator&amp;rsquo; property of the ALT Text field using CQs ExtJS.</description>
