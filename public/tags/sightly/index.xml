      <description>In AEM when you create a new page component with a editable area that uses the responsive grid (wcm/foundation/components/responsivegrid) you might experience an issue where the editable area appears, but has no height, and is unusable. All you get is a thin blue line where the editable area should be.
The cause of this is a missing include. To initialize the AEM editing features, an JSP is loaded that initializes all of the editable areas, as well as some other things.</description>
