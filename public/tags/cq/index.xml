      <description>*Update (2014.11.24): The post below references an issue with a Component in CQ 5.5. I finally heard back from Adobe support and the issue has been resolved in CQ 5.6.1 by removing the Adaptive feature. They provided this forum post as a reference.*
Recently I was perusing crawl errors from Google&amp;rsquo;s Webmaster Tools to find any issues that had not yet been reported. I came across dozens of 500 errors coming from requests to one particular page.</description>

      <title>Smart ALT field validation</title>

      <description>We had a requirement to enforce alt attributes on images. Sounds simple, just set the alt field to required. The problem is when you do that for components that use images, like Text &amp;amp; Image. If a user decides to enter text, but not use the image portion the ALT text is still required, and the alert for a missing field still appears.
To fix this we add a function to the &amp;lsquo;validator&amp;rsquo; property of the ALT Text field using CQs ExtJS.</description>
