      <p>In AEM when you create a new page component with a editable area that uses the responsive grid (<code>wcm/foundation/components/responsivegrid</code>) you might experience an issue where the editable area appears, but has no height, and is unusable. All you get is a thin blue line where the editable area should be.</p>

<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fjyznpqt1kqgzexdvwe4.png" alt="Screenshot of unusable editable area" /></p>

<p>The cause of this is a missing include. To initialize the AEM editing features, an JSP is loaded that initializes all of the editable areas, as well as some other things.</p>

<p>The solution is to add the following in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your page component</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">    &lt;!--/* Initializes the Experience Manager authoring UI */--&gt;
    &lt;sly data-sly-include=&quot;/libs/wcm/core/components/init/init.jsp&quot; data-sly-unwrap/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can remove the comment, but I like to leave it in so I, or anyone else editing the page component, knows why we have it in there. Now you&rsquo;ll see your editable area ready to add components.</p>
