      <p>I needed to remember who was working with me on a certain project over the last year. I had some trouble remembering, because this last year has been crazy personally, and the project overlapped a couple years. All the years and months and days were running together in my brain.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have git logs, but it&rsquo;s not straightforward. I came up with this set of commands to help with the task:</p>

<pre><code>git log --pretty=format:&quot;%an&quot; | \
    sort | \
    uniq | \
    awk '{system(&quot;git log -1 --author=&quot;$1 &quot; --pretty=format:\&quot;%ad%x09%an\&quot;&quot;); print &quot;\r&quot;}' | \
    sort -k5n -k2M -k3n
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>get all of the user names in the git logs</li>
<li>sort them lexically</li>
<li>remove repeats (sort -u could have replaced these)</li>
<li>do another git log for each user, but print out their last commit, and format it to be just the date and their name separated by a tab.</li>
<li>Sort by the columns (year, month, date)</li>
</ol>
